        <div>YOOOO HIT ME UP!......Wow, so your origin is what? You fell into a vat of redundancy? Awww, bitch! Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me? Well, she's my daughter, Summer. I outrank you. Or, family means nothing, in which case, don't play that card.

        There is no god, Summer; gotta rip that band-aid off now you'll thank me later. Rikitikitavi, bitch! We need a hang glider, and a crotch less uncle sam costume, and I want the entire field of your largest stadium covered end to end with naked red heads, and I want the stands packed with every man that remotely resembles my father. Like nothing shady ever happened in a fully furnished office? You ever hear about Wall Street Morty? You know what those guys do in their fancy board rooms? They take their balls and dip 'em in cocaine and wipe 'em all over each other. You know Grandpa goes around and he does his business in public because grandpa isn't shady.
        
        Oh good job Morty! You killed my best customer but you saved a mind reading fart! Existence is pain to a meeseeks Jerry, and we will do anything to alleviate that pain. God, Grandpa, you're such a dick. This is Principal Vagina. No relation.
        
        I'd like to order one large person with extra people please. white people, no no no black people... and hispanic on half. It's not like we can do this every week, we get 3 or 4 more of these tops. You gotta shove these seeds way up your butt Morty, waay up there. What the fuck is going on?!</div>
